There is no quit/win condition at the moment - to exit the game, alt-tab out and close it.

We are aware that it's super hard to fly straight b/c we have no deadzone for the mouse - we are working on fixing that.

We would like to hear back about how it feels overall - is it too hard to aim, fly, hit stuff, etc?

To increase the level quickly, fly towards the space station that is ahead and near the top of your screen when you spawn. Each level increases the amount of asteroids spawned by 10.

Currently, all asteroids are set to die when hit by a single shot - this is intentional and will be changed later.

Ignore the SAFE and TURN AROUND words at the top - they're merely there to tell you when you're leaving the boundary of the torus within which the asteroids move. SAFE means you're still inside, TURN AROUND means you're leaving the world area.
